;;; Commentary:

;; Original versions based on:
;;
;;     URL `http://evgeni.io/posts/travis-for-emacs-packages/'
;;
;; Emacs-Make is driven by environment variables to know what to do.
;; Before invoking `emake', ensure the following variables are set
;; appropriately:
;;
;;     PACKAGE_FILE     := the root file of your package
;;     PACKAGE_TESTS    := space-delimited list of Lisp files to load
;;                         to define your tests
;;     PACKAGE_LISP     := space-delimited list of Lisp files in this
;;                         package
;;     PACKAGE_ARCHIVES := space-delimited list of named ELPA archives;
;;                         see also `emake-package-archive-master-alist'
;;
;; There are certainly scenarios where a testing suite would want to
;; use special packages in its own right, but not require them for its
;; users.  For this case, a few more variables exist:
;;
;;     PACKAGE_TEST_DEPS     := space-delimited list of packages needed
;;                              by the test suite
;;     PACKAGE_TEST_ARCHIVES := like PACKAGE_ARCHIVES, but used for
;;                              installing PACKAGE_TEST_DEPS.
;;
;; To debug Emacs-Make, set the environment variable EMACS_MAKE_DEBUG_MODE.
;;
;; See the file README.org in this directory for more information and
;; minimal examples.
